        <h2>Goal</h2>

        <p>The goal of this game is to acquire as many targets as possible. This will be done by placing trait cards and arguing/discussing with your fellow Love Rivals. The first player to get 15 total stars wins the game. If no one has 15 points by the time all the targets have been captured, whoever has the highest points wins the game.</p>

            <h3>Targets:</h3>
            <p> Capturable love interests that are rated by stars (1-5 stars), each love interest has blanks to be filled "by trait cards"</p>

            <h3>Trait cards:</h3>
            <p>cards used to fill the blanks of target blanks, they are categorized under nine different topics (Hobbies, Food, Items, Music Genre, Proficiency, Animals, Personality, Occupations, Vehicles), higher rated targets will have more specific blank requirements that give love rivals a chance to score bonus star points</p>

            <h3>Action Cards:</h3> 
            <p>These are cards that will be used during play to either draw new cards, replace a love rival's trait card on the field or a special card that only the Mediator of Love can use</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Love rivals will draw a hand of five from the "drawing pile" (this is made up of trait cards and action cards) at the start of the game, then figure out who will start as the Mediator of Hearts (a judge position that will be passed on clockwise to the next player). </li>
            <li>With two capturable targets laid down on the field, rivals will place down their most suitable categorized or non-categorized card [trait card] to fill the target's blanks</li>
            <li>Rivals will then debate for their trait card while reasoning with the current round's mediator why their card is better than the rest.</li>
            <li>As the mediator, your job is to hear the arguments amongst the love rivals and choose what you feel is the best one. If you are choosing before hearing arguments, other rivals may chip in and oppose the decision to possibly change the mediator's choice.  [Note that the mediator of the round will not place any cards, but listen to the rivals' debates for their own cards and at the end choose which love rival deserves the captured target, get ready for intellectual and eloquent warfare]</li>
            <li>After targets are claimed by individual love rivals, the next round will begin by having the next rival (clockwise to mediator before) place down new targets from the target pile. The rest of the trait cards on the field and any action cards used during play will be placed in a discard pile.  [Note that if a target on the field was not claimed, place them at the bottom of the target pile to refresh the field]</li>
